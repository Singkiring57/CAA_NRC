1. What is it? 
Allows for immigrants from certain communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to acquire citizenship.

2. Evident Problems
Muslims are excluded from acquiring citizenship solely on the basis of religion. Furthermore, definition of illegal migrants restricted to only three countries, this excluding other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, etc. 

3. Why is this problematic?
Our Constitution envisages India to be a secular state. This means that no distinction can be made between persons solely on the basis of religion. Hence, excluding Muslims expressly violates the secular nature of our Constitution.

4. Regional Restrictions
There is no rational basis for restricting the countries from which inflow is allowed to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The amendment allegedly aims to protect persecuted minorities. Then what about the Tamils from Sri Lanka, the Rohingyas from Myanmar, the Nepali Gorkhas and the Uighurs and Ahmadiyas facing persecution? The amendment does not consider this.

5. What about the NRC?
The National Register of Citizens, first implemented in Assam, required a person to produce documents of her ancestry in order to be eligible for citizenship. This falls hard on even legitimate citizens due to lack of necessary documents. Therefore even citizens can get excluded under the NRC, like in Assam, where over 19 lakh applicants were excluded from the final list.

5. NRC & CAA - a double threat?
Now, if an Indian citizen gets excluded under the NRC, and if she is a non-Muslim, she can claim citizenship under the CAA. However, if she happens to be a Muslim, then CAA ensures that she will not be granted citizenship as a naturalised migrant.
